# FitLit App

This project is a fit-bit like application that utilizes a dataset of 50 people and records their Sleep, Activity, Hydration, and Personal data, then displays them on a website. 

For the second part of the project, the code was refactored to make user of class inheritance, fetch calls, and accessibility practices.

The changes that were made were:

1. The creation of a parent class, which contained methods that were used in multiple classes.

2. The addition of fetch calls to get data from a server, and add data to data list with POST.

3. Best practices for accessibility and a few ARIA elements for non-descriptive HTML.
